# turtleBot
ROS TurtleBot DIY Omni Wheel base

Kinect and Omni Wheel Based Raspberry Pi ROS Rover

GOAL: To implement TeleOperation, Mapping and Navigation

So it seems that my raw notes are being interpretted as markdown and different line endings are creating issues - 

So I will just put up a simple README.txt file besides this one until I figure out the markdown, but I dont want to spend any time on formatting and such.

This is raw logging of my work, not intended to explain, but if you are following this and wanna talk, hit me up.

ALL LOG has been moved to README.txt
